## Welcome to UniCafe Data Analysis

UniCafe is the largest provider of meals to students at the University of Helsinki, serving hundreds of thousands of meals per year.

Here we'll be diving into some of their data!

### Coffee


### Food Waste
The average customer disposes 40g of biowaste per meal. This may not sounds like a lot, but keep in mind that this number is multiplied by the hundreds of thousands of meals served per year! This is perfectly good food heading to the trash, which is bad for the environment and bad for UniCafe's business.

We wanted to draw attention to this problem that we think most youth overlook. What better way than an ad campaign?

By drawing on UniCafe's food waste data, we created posters to visualize and hopefully inspire an emotional response in the people that view this poster (which we believe would be best placed before people serve themselves food).
